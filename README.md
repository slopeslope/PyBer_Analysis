# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze the ride sharing data of cities. 
During the process of the analysis, we separated the faces by city types(rural, suburban and urban) and ordered them by date. We then added the fares weekly and created this scatter plot with this information. 
In the conclusion, the results showed that the urban cities made much more money than rural cities. This is because there is a higher density of people and the fares are higher. 

Although in rural cities the average fares for driver and ride is much higher than the urban average, the amount of people actually getting rides in urban cities is much higher and therefore much more profitable. We should also look into the average age of the riders and the places they go to the most.
