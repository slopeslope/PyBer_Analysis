# Pyber_Analysis
The purpose of the analysis was to analyze the ride sharing data of cities. 
During the process of the analysis, we separated the faces by city types(rural, suburban and urban) and ordered them by date. We then added the fares weekly and created this scatter plot with this information. 
In the conclusion, the results showed that the urban cities made much more money than rural cities. This is because there is a higher density of people and the fares are higher. 

The difficulties I had with this particular data set was that it lacked critical information that, in my opinion, would be very important. The data set was very general and to really provide a thorough analysis, the data set would have to include the demographics of the people riding and to where they are going, whether its to school, work, recreational areas, etc. 
With this information we can really dial down the information of each specific ride and add it to the overall picture of the analysis.  

Although in rural cities the average fares for driver and ride is much higher than the urban average, the amount of people actually getting rides in urban cities is much higher and therefore much more profitable. 
As I mentioned before, the two analysis that should be really looked into are the demographics and to where the riders are going to. 
In order to get this data, we should look at the age and race of every person taking the ride and document where the end the ride along with its fare and correlate it with their destination.
